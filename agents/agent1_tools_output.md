QUERY 2: Calculate DAU/MAU for a product with 50,000 daily users and 200,000 monthly users
I'll calculate the DAU/MAU ratio for your product using the PM metric calculator.
Tool #2: pm_metric_calculator
Based on your product metrics:

- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: 50,000
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: 200,000
- **DAU/MAU Ratio**: 0.25 (25%)

**Interpretation**: This 25% ratio indicates that your product "needs improvement" as it's below the 40% benchmark for good user engagement.

This means that on average, only 25% of your monthly users are engaging with your product on any given day. A higher DAU/MAU ratio (typically 40% or above) would indicate better user stickiness and engagement.Based on your product metrics:

QUERY 3: Compare stickiness: Product A has 60k DAU and 150k MAU, Product B has 40k DAU and 80k MAU
I'll calculate the DAU/MAU ratios for both products to compare their stickiness.
Tool #3: pm_metric_calculator

Tool #4: pm_metric_calculator
Here's the stickiness comparison between the two products:

## Product A
- **DAU**: 60,000
- **MAU**: 150,000
- **DAU/MAU Ratio**: 40.0%
- **Interpretation**: Needs improvement (<40%)

## Product B
- **DAU**: 40,000
- **MAU**: 80,000
- **DAU/MAU Ratio**: 50.0%
- **Interpretation**: Good (40-60%)

## Comparison Summary

**Product B has better stickiness** despite having fewer absolute users:

- Product B's 50% stickiness means half of its monthly users engage daily
- Product A's 40% stickiness means only 2 out of 5 monthly users engage daily
- Product B crosses into the "Good" category while Product A is still in "Needs improvement"

This shows that **Product B is more effective at retaining and engaging its user base**, even though Product A has a larger user volume. Product B users are more likely to return and use the product regularly, indicating stronger product-market fit and user satisfaction.Here's the stickiness comparison between the two products:
