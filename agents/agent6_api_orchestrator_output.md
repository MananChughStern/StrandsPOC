MULTI-TOOL AGENT: DYNAMIC TOOL SELECTION TEST
TEST 1: Basic arithmetic
Expected tool: calculator

Query: What's 15% of $2.4 million?
I'll calculate 15% of $2.4 million for you.
Tool #1: calculator
15% of $2.4 million is **$0.36 million**, which equals **$360,000**.
Agent Response:
15% of $2.4 million is **$0.36 million**, which equals **$360,000**.

TEST 2: Company valuation
Expected tool: company_valuation

Query: Estimate the valuation of a SaaS company with $50M annual revenue growing at 80% year-over-year
I'll estimate the valuation of this SaaS company using revenue multiples based on its growth profile.
Tool #2: company_valuation
Based on the revenue multiple methodology for high-growth SaaS companies, here's the valuation estimate:

**Estimated Valuation: $750 million**

**Valuation Range: $600M - $900M**

**Methodology:**
- Applied a 15x revenue multiple for a SaaS company with 80% growth
- This high multiple reflects the exceptional growth rate (80% YoY is well above typical SaaS growth rates)
- High-growth SaaS companies typically command premium valuations due to their recurring revenue model and scalability

**Key Factors:**
- $50M ARR is a substantial revenue base
- 80% growth rate indicates strong market demand and execution
- SaaS business model provides predictable, recurring revenue streams
- The valuation assumes the company can maintain reasonable growth trajectory and unit economics

This valuation would put the company in the upper tier of SaaS valuations, reflecting both its scale and exceptional growth rate.

TEST 3: Calculate existing multiple
Expected tool: calculator

Query: If a company is valued at $400M with $40M revenue, what's the revenue multiple?
I'll calculate the revenue multiple for this company.
Tool #3: calculator
The revenue multiple is **10x**.

**Calculation:**
- Valuation: $400M
- Revenue: $40M
- Revenue Multiple = Valuation ÷ Revenue = $400M ÷ $40M = **10x**

This 10x revenue multiple suggests the company is likely:
- A profitable or near-profitable business
- Growing at a moderate to good rate (typically 20-50% for SaaS)
- In a stable industry with predictable revenue streams
- Possibly a more mature company compared to high-growth startups that might command 15x+ multiples

Revenue multiples typically range from 3-5x for traditional businesses up to 20x+ for exceptional high-growth tech companies.
Agent Response:
The revenue multiple is **10x**.

**Calculation:**
- Valuation: $400M
- Revenue: $40M
- Revenue Multiple = Valuation ÷ Revenue = $400M ÷ $40M = **10x**

This 10x revenue multiple suggests the company is likely:
- A profitable or near-profitable business
- Growing at a moderate to good rate (typically 20-50% for SaaS)
- In a stable industry with predictable revenue streams
- Possibly a more mature company compared to high-growth startups that might command 15x+ multiples

Revenue multiples typically range from 3-5x for traditional businesses up to 20x+ for exceptional high-growth tech companies.

TEST 4: Market analysis
Expected tool: market_sizing

Query: If the AI agent market is $5B and we want to capture 3% over 4 years, what's our revenue projection?
I'll calculate the revenue projection for capturing 3% of the $5B AI agent market over 4 years.
Tool #4: market_sizing
Based on capturing 3% of the $5B AI agent market over 4 years, here's your revenue projection:

**Target Revenue by Year 4: $150 million**

**Year-by-Year Revenue Projections:**
- **Year 1:** $37.5M (0.75% market share)
- **Year 2:** $75.0M (1.5% market share)
- **Year 3:** $112.5M (2.25% market share)
- **Year 4:** $150.0M (3.0% market share)

**Key Insights:**
- Total addressable market: $5B
- Target market share: 3% = $150M opportunity
- Linear growth assumption: 0.75% market share increase per year
- This represents strong growth trajectory in a large, emerging market

**Considerations:**
- The AI agent market is rapidly expanding, so the actual TAM may grow beyond $5B over this timeframe
- Competition will be intense in this space
- Achieving 3% market share would position you as a significant player
- Revenue growth accelerates each year as you build market presence and scale

This projection assumes steady market penetration - actual growth may be more exponential initially then plateau as you reach target share.

TEST 5: Compound analysis
Expected tool: multiple

Query: A fintech startup has $20M revenue growing 60% annually in a $10B market. Estimate their valuation and if they captured 2% market share, what would that revenue be?
I'll help you with both analyses - the valuation estimate and the market share revenue calculation.
Tool #5: company_valuation

Tool #6: calculator
Here's the complete analysis for this fintech startup:

## **Valuation Estimate**
**Current Estimated Valuation: $240 million**
- **Valuation Range:** $192M - $288M
- **Methodology:** 12x revenue multiple for fintech with 60% growth

## **Market Share Revenue Potential**
**2% of $10B market = $200 million**

## **Key Insights:**

**Current Position:**
- $20M revenue represents 0.2% of the $10B market
- 60% growth rate is excellent for fintech sector
- 12x revenue multiple reflects strong growth and fintech premium

**Growth Opportunity:**
- To reach 2% market share ($200M revenue), they need to grow 10x from current size
- At 60% annual growth, this would take approximately 4 years
- This represents significant upside potential if they can maintain growth trajectory

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Currently a small player with high growth potential
- Large addressable market provides substantial runway
- Fintech valuations can be volatile but generally command good multiples for profitable growth
- Achieving 2% market share would likely result in a valuation of $2B+ (10x revenue at that scale)

The company appears well-positioned with strong growth in a large market, suggesting significant value creation potential.

Complex Scenario:

    Analyze this scenario:
    
    Company: AI Infrastructure Startup
    - Current revenue: $30M annually
    - Growth rate: 100% YoY
    - Industry: Saas
    - Market: $8B TAM
    
    Questions:
    1. What is their estimated valuation?
    2. If they maintain this growth and capture 4% market share in 5 years, what would their revenue be?
    3. What would their valuation be at that point (assuming growth slows to 30%)?

I'll analyze this AI Infrastructure Startup scenario step by step, using the appropriate tools to answer each question.

## Question 1: Current Estimated Valuation
Tool #1: company_valuation
## Question 2: Revenue with 4% Market Share in 5 Years
Tool #2: market_sizing
Let me also check if maintaining 100% growth would get them to this target revenue:
Tool #3: calculator
## Question 3: Valuation at $320M Revenue with 30% Growth
Tool #4: company_valuation
## Analysis Summary

### 1. Current Estimated Valuation: **$450M**
- **Range:** $360M - $540M
- **Methodology:** 15x revenue multiple for SaaS with 100% growth
- The high growth rate commands a premium multiple

### 2. Revenue Scenario in 5 Years: **$320M**
- **Target:** 4% of $8B TAM = $320M
- **Current trajectory:** If they maintain 100% growth, they'd reach $960M in 5 years
- **Implication:** The 4% market share target ($320M) is actually conservative compared to their current growth trajectory

### 3. Future Valuation at $320M Revenue: **$4.0B**
- **Range:** $3.2B - $4.8B
- **Methodology:** 12.5x revenue multiple for SaaS with 30% growth
- **Growth multiple:** Lower than current due to slower growth (30% vs 100%)

## Key Insights

1. **Growth Trajectory Mismatch:** The company's current 100% growth would lead to $960M revenue in 5 years, significantly exceeding the 4% market share scenario ($320M).

2. **Valuation Growth:** Despite slower growth rates in the future scenario, the absolute valuation would increase dramatically from $450M to $4.0B due to the substantial revenue increase.

3. **Multiple Compression:** The revenue multiple decreases from 15x to 12.5x as growth slows from 100% to 30%, which is typical in SaaS valuations.

4. **Conservative Market Share:** Capturing only 4% of an $8B TAM seems modest given their current explosive growth rate.
